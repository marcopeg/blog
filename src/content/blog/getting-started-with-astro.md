# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern static site generator that helps you build faster websites with less client-side JavaScript. It's perfect for content-focused sites like blogs, documentation, and marketing pages.

- Ship zero JavaScript by default
- Use your favorite UI framework (React, Vue, Svelte)
- Partial hydration for interactive components
- Built-in performance optimizations

## Key Features

1. **Zero JavaScript by Default**: Astro generates static HTML with no JavaScript overhead
2. **Bring Your Own Framework**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any other framework
3. **Content Collections**: Type-safe markdown content management
4. **Fast Builds**: Optimized build process for quick iteration
